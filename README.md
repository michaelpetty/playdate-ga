# PlayDate

*"It's Tinder - for pets! Kind of!"*

PlayDate is, as the name implies, a way to facilitate playdates for pets. "Pets" browse through a carousel of other user's pets, and choose to skip or "lick" them. If both pets lick each other, it's a match! Chat keeps track of all your matches so you can schedule a fun-filled day.
